# Chat Application Homework
This is my attempt to develop the Chat App further. It's pretty sad. 

## Requirements / Getting Set Up
Node, NPM and Express

1. Clone project into a directory
2. Run NPM install to get all dependencies
3. Navigate to root of project and run node app (or nodemon app so that you don't have to keep restarting your server)
4. Navigate to localhost:3000
